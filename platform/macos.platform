# macOS
#
# Detailed Installation Notes:
# - Install Xcode from AppStore, open it and accept the license.
# - Open Terminal, and install Xcode command line tools via
# $  xcode-select --install
# and then run
# $  xcodebuild -license
# and accept the license.
#
# Make sure you can run
# $ clang -v
# (it might trigger an installation the first time you run it).
#
# - Install Homebrew in a Terminal via
# $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
#
# - Install the following via Homebrew
# $  brew install cmake gcc@11 openmpi
#
# - Export compiler environment:
#
# If you are running an ARM based macOS device (M1, M2, etc.), we strongly recommend
# using the clang compiler, which is the default. You can check so by running
# $ mpicxx -v
# If it reports "clang", you are good to go.
#
# If you are not running on an ARM device (traditional Intel based laptops), we
# strongly recommend using gcc instead of clang. This can be achieved by running
#
# Finally, ARM support is still experimental and not all packages and options work
# without problems. It might be easiest to start by only enabling the packages
# you care about.
#
# If you are missing any steps, abort this installation now, do the changes and then
# run candi again!

#
# If you encounter runtime problems with missing *.dylib libraries,
# you may change the security policy for developments. To do so,
# enable Terminal in System Preferences / Security & Privacy / Developer Tools .
